# MultiversX OpenClaw Relayer Service

A secure, high-performance general relayer service for OpenClaw agents on MultiversX. This service enables agents to submit transactions without holding EGLD for gas, using the Relayed V3 protocol.

## Features

- **🚀 Relayed V3 Support**: Automatically wraps and signs transactions for gasless execution.
- **🔒 Production Ready**: Built with Express, secure configuration management, and comprehensive testing.
- **🛡️ Security First**:
    - **Identity Verification**: Enforces MX-8004 Registry checks to ensure only authorized agents can relay.
    - **Quota Management**: Rate limiting per agent to prevent gas draining.
    - **Signature Validation**: Strict verification of inner transaction signatures.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18
- A MultiversX Wallet PEM file (`relayer.pem`) with funds for gas.

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sasurobert/multiversx-openclaw-relayer.git
cd multiversx-openclaw-relayer
npm install
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Network Configuration
NETWORK_PROVIDER=https://devnet-gateway.multiversx.com
IDENTITY_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=erd1qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq6gq4hu

# Relayer Wallet
RELAYER_PEM_PATH=./relayer.pem

# Security & Limits
QUOTA_LIMIT=10  # Max transactions per agent per 24h
DB_PATH=./relayer.db # For persistent quota tracking
PORT=3000
```

### Running the Service

**Development:**
```bash
npm run start
```

**Production:**
```bash
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

## API Reference

  "receiver": "erd1...",
  "sender": "erd1...",
  "gasPrice": 1000000000,
  "gasLimit": 50000,
  "data": "base64...",
  "chainID": "D",
  "version": 1,

}
```

**Response (200 OK):**

}
```

**Errors:**

## Architecture

The service is composed of three layers:
1. **API Layer** (`src/api`): specific Express handlers.
2. **Service Layer** (`src/services`): `RelayerService` for logic and `QuotaManager` for limits.
3. **Core Layer** (`sdk-core`): MultiversX interactions.

## Security

This service implements **MX-8004** compliance checks. It verifies that the sender is a registered agent in the On-Chain Identity Registry before relaying any transaction.

## Testing

Run the full test suite (Unit + Integration):

```bash
npm test
```
