        // Standard is: last byte of pubkey is mapped to shard.
        // However, let's trust the SDK Address implementation if used generally, 
        // but for now I will rely on the property of the Loaded Address to create the map.
        // When checking for a user, I will use their address to find THEIR shard.

        // We need to know which shard a given address belongs to.
        // In this method, 'address' is the RELAYER'S address.
        // But we also need 'getRelayerForUser(userAddress)'.

        // For MultiversX:
        // mask = numShards - 1 (if power of 2) or more complex.
        // Default devnet often has 3 shards (0, 1, 2).
        // Let's rely on a simplified assumption or standard logic if not critical to implement fully from scratch.
        // Actually, easiest is to let the network provider tell us, OR implement standard logic.
        // Implementation:
        // const pubKey = address.getPublicKey();
        // const lastByte = pubKey[31];
        // // Shard logic depends on network config (metachain, num shards).

        // return address.getShard(); // SDK Address should have this if constructed with network config?

        // Wait, Address class in sdk-core usually doesn't know about network config (num shards).
        // It serves utility. 
        // We might need to inject 'numberOfShards'.

        // For this specific issue: The Relayer MUST be in the same shard as the sender.
        // So we need to match Shard(Relayer) == Shard(Sender).

        // How do we compute Shard(Sender)?
        // We can accept it as a param or compute it.
        // Let's compute it assuming standard 3 shards configuration if no config provided.
        // OR better: The Manager holds ALL available relayers. When asked for a relayer for UserA,
        // it computes UserA's shard, and returns the Relayer for that shard.

        // To be safe, let's implementation standard shard computation.
        // number_of_shards = 3 (default for now)

        // Actually, `Address` from sdk-core does NOT expose getShard() directly without config context usually?
        // Let's check `Address` or implement getShard manually.
        // Reference: https://docs.multiversx.com/developers/developer-reference/sc-annotations/#address-structure

        const hex = address.toHex();
        const buffer = Buffer.from(hex, "hex");
        const startingIndex = buffer.length === 32 ? 31 : 33; // 32 bytes for user address
        const lastByte = buffer[startingIndex];

        // Sharding on Devnet/Mainnet: 3 shards.
        // Shard 0: 0, 3, 6...
        // Shard 1: 1, 4, 7...
        // Shard 2: 2, 5, 8...
        // BUT Metachain is different.

        // Simplification: We will just try to match based on available wallets.
        // If we have a wallet that "claims" to be shard X, we use it for user in shard X.
        // Ideally we'd use a robust utility.

        // Let's just create a dummy helper here that does module 3 for now, 
        // but cleaner is to rely on what the Relayer Service *knows* about its wallets.
        // We can just iterate through our loaded relayers and check `getShardOf(relayer) == getShardOf(user)`.
